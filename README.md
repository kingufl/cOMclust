cOMclust

An error correction tool for optical mapping data using OMclust to find overlapping Rmaps

*Note that cOMclust needs a cluster centers file which can be generated by training the model using OMclust

Quick steps:

    Compile the package in the root folder: make
    Go to bin folder
    Run cOMclust: ./cOMclust <Rmap_input_file_path_and_filename> <cluster_centers_file> <number_of_streams> <stream_index>

cOMclust is set up for parallel processing. If running on a single machine use number_of_streams = 1 and stream_index=1. For running in parallel, specify the number of streams and use stream index from 1 to number_of_streams+1. For example, if total number of Rmaps is 1,000,000 and total number of streams is 1000. Then stream_index=1 will error correct Rmaps 1 to 1000. stream_index=2 will error correct Rmaps 1001 to 2000 and so on.
